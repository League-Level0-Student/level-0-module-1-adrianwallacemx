1. Complete the for loop below so that it prints out the numbers 1-­10.
for( int i =1;            ; i    <   10     ;    i++         )
{ 
}
2. Complete the for loop below so that it counts down and prints out 75 to 50.
for(   int i=75;           ;  i    >   50    ;    i--         )
{ 
}
3. Describe briefly what each part of the for loop does: 
for( a ; b ; c )
{               } 
a) the starting variable
b) showing how much time its going to loop
c) showing if the variable is less than or grader than the number
